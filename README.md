Nim is a numerical round of methodology in which two players alternate eliminating (or "nimming") objects from unmistakable stores or heaps. On each turn, a player should eliminate in any event one item, and may eliminate quite a few articles gave they all come from a similar store or heap. Contingent upon the adaptation being played, the objective of the game is either to try not to take the last item or to take the last article.
